# NetShare
Simple network share maker

This script creates a share on a local machine and maps it to a remote machine. 
It is designed to be run on two machines to create a share between them.
The first run will create the config file. Run on the second machine to add the second machine to the config file.
Once the config file is complete, copy it to the first machine and run the script on both machines to create the share.
The shares will be mapped as the Z drive on the other PC.

I have included the PowerShell source file as well as the exe. you only need to run one version.
